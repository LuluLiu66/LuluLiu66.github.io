    <h4>For this autonomy is an ideal, in reality it only exists more or less completely.</h4>
    <h4>That is why Sigmund Freud saw many people on the level of a child.</h4>
    <h4>Who only is afraid of external authority.</h4>
    <h4>Many adults are not able to internalize, such a mature super-ego that really gives autonomy.</h4>
    <h4>But unconsciously remain always dependent on parents or later on social authorities, who tell them what to do and what to refrain.</h4>
