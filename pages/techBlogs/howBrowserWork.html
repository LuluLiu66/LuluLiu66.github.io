    how web browsers work<br />
    1. navigation<br />
    <br />
    2. fetching data<br />
    <br />
    3. parsing the HTML<br />
    4. parsing the CSS<br />
    5. executing the javascript<br />
    <br />
    6. creating the accessibility tree<br />
    7. the render tree  <br />

    <div>
        <h3>1. navigation</h3>
        <div>
            DNS Lookup - resolving the web address, only at the first time of visiting), between Browser and DNS Server <br />
            TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) - between browser and the server which hold resource, via a three-way handshake(SYN=>SYN-ACK=>ACK)<br />
            TLS negotiation - for secure connections established over HTTPS, another handshake is needed. TLS negotiation determins which cipher will be used to encrypt the communication. <br/>
            <ul>
                <li>1. Clienty says hello</li>
                <li>2. Server hello message and certificate</li>
                <li>3. Authentication</li>
                <li>4. The premaster secret</li>
                <li>5. Private kay used. The server decrypts the premaster secret</li>
                <li>6. Session keys created. From the client random, the server random, premaster secret</li>
                <li>7. Client finished.</li>
                <li>8. Server finished.</li>
                <li>9. Secure symmetric encryption achieved</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>2. data fetching</h3>
        <div>
            HTTP Request - an initial HTTP GET request, request for the HTML document, using HTTP protocol<br />
            The method - post, get, put, patch, delete etc <br />
            URI - stands for Uniform Resource Identifier. make up of 5 parts: scheme, authority, path, query, fragment<br/>
            Request header fields - 
            Respnse header fileds - 
            HTTP Payload - 
            HTTP Respnse - 
            Status code - 
            TCP Slow Start and congestion algorithms<br/>
            "Slow Start" is an algorithm that balances the speed of a network connection. The first data packet will be 14kb (or smaller) and the way it works is that the amount of data transmitted is increased gradually until a predermined threshhold is reached.<br/>
            "congestion algorithms" is since the connection has a limited capacity, if the server sends too many packets too quickly, they will be dropped, and the client won't send any ACK.
